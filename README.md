# AI-chatbot
<h2>This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot, which combines two powerful approaches: retrieval-based and generative-based models to provide accurate and conversational responses.</h2>

<h4>How It Works:</h4>
<p>User Input: The user asks a question in the chatbot interface.</p>
Retrieve Information: The chatbot searches a knowledge base or external data source to find the most relevant information related to the question.
Generate a Response: Using this information, the chatbot creates a natural, human-like response that is accurate and based on facts.
Reply to User: The chatbot returns the generated response to the user in a conversational way.
Key Features:
Accurate Responses: The chatbot uses real information from the knowledge base, so the answers are factual and reliable.
Conversational: The generative model makes the responses feel more natural and conversational, improving user experience.
Customizable: The chatbot can be customized to use different knowledge sources depending on the application, such as customer support, healthcare, or education.
